"""Tests for calculate_tube_test (head-on tunnel encounters).

A tube-test event: the loser enters a tunnel and retreats to the cage it came
from, while the winner enters the same tunnel from the opposite end during an
overlapping interval and exits later. The winner either follows the loser into
the cage it retreated to (CHASE) or returns to its own origin cage (GUARD).

Contact is found by a sweep over tunnel occupancy intervals, so pairing is by real
time overlap and an encounter straddling an hour, phase or day boundary still counts.

calculate_tube_test reads main_df via Recording.load_results (monkeypatched here) and
is called directly. Most cases use the linear layout of
strategies.analysis_cfg, where positions never repeat consecutively per animal so
_resolve_repeat_reads is a no-op; the cases that exercise the repeat-read path use
strategies.ring_cfg, whose antennas sit at the tunnel mouths as in a real setup.
