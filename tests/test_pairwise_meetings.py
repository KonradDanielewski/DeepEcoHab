"""Tests for calculate_pairwise_meetings (co-occurrence time and encounter counts).

A sweep-line over occupancy intervals (the same intervals _get_time_alone reads, via
_occupancy_intervals) finds spans where >=2 animals share a position - a cage or a
tunnel, with tunnel directionality collapsed first - decodes the present set, stitches
temporally-contiguous spans of the same pair into one meeting, drops meetings
shorter than ``minimum_time`` and sums onto the dense grid. padded_df is read via
Recording.load_results (monkeypatched); the step is called directly.

padded_df rows carry the interval END in ``datetime`` and its length in
``time_spent``; all events sit in day-1 light_phase.
