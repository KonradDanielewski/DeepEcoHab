"""Tests for calculate_chasings (per-hour chasing counts on the dense grid).

calculate_chasings aggregates the event-level match_df into per-(chaser, chased,
tunnel, hour) counts and reindexes them onto the dense ordered-pair x tunnel grid
so absent cells are 0. It reads match_df via Recording.load_results, which we
monkeypatch; the step is called directly.

All events are placed in day-1 light_phase so the run-length phase_count of the
hand-built match_df equals the grid's numbering (the first light phase is 1).
