"""Tests for calculate_matches (event-level chasing detection).

A chasing event is a loser exiting a tunnel and a winner who entered that same
tunnel from a cage 0.1-1.2 s earlier, exiting after the loser. calculate_matches
reads main_df via Recording.load_results, so we monkeypatch that to feed a hand-built
main_df and call the step directly, as test_ranking does.

main_df rows mark the position an animal *left* and when it left, so a tunnel row
is a tunnel *exit* and its (shifted) predecessor supplies the tunnel entry time
and the cage it came from.
