"""Tests for analysing several recordings at once.

Recordings share nothing - their own results/ directory, a step graph that is read-only
once imported - so the outer loop of the pipeline is run concurrently. These tests pin
what that must not cost: the same tables as a serial run, every step still produced and
reported exactly once, and a failure that neither hides nor strands the other recordings.
