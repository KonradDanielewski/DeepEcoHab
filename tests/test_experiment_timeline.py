"""Tests for the egocentric experiment timeline.

Recordings are compared by where they are in their own experiment rather than by wall
clock, so day 1 hour 0 is the first onset of the phase named in ``start_from`` and
anything recorded before it is trimmed. These tests cover resolving that origin and the
grid that follows from it - including the case the minute walk exists for, where one
hourly bin holds two phases.
