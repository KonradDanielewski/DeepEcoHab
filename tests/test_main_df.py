"""Tests for build_main_df and build_padded_df (the two tables everything reads).

build_main_df resolves each registration's position from the antenna pair, carries the
last known position on past the final read, and only then trims the lead-in before the
experiment start. build_padded_df cuts the resulting visits at every minute mark and
re-dates each piece by its own start.

Both steps are called directly on a Recording whose ``data`` is a hand-built frame of
raw registrations; padded_df reads main_df via ``Recording.load_results``, which is
monkeypatched as elsewhere.
