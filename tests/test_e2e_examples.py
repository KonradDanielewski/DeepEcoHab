"""End-to-end test of the whole pipeline on the bundled example recordings.

Drives the public API exactly as ``examples/new_backend_prototype.ipynb`` does -
create a project, add every recording in ``examples/data``, run every registered
step, sink the auxiliary tube test, aggregate the project table, then build every
registered plot - so it guards the create -> analyse -> plot path on real data.
The focused unit tests feed synthetic frames one step at a time and cannot see
the relationships *between* the produced tables, which is what is asserted here.

The example data ships with the repository, so this test never skips: if the
data is gone, that is the failure.
