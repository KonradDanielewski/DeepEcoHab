"""Tests for recording boundaries and interpolated reads from the acquisition software.

Run on a synthetic Europe/Warsaw recording whose reads stop from 03:20 to 07:00: its
``diagnostic.json`` holds that stop as one boundary, in UTC, and every fifth read is
flagged ``inserted``. Each animal's last read before the stop is at antenna 3 and its
first after at antenna 1, a step that would cross antenna 2 unread were it not a stop.
