"""Property/invariant tests for the antenna_analysis steps.

Where the per-function tests in ``test_*.py`` pin specific hand-computed values,
these draw randomised-but-valid inputs with Hypothesis and assert relationships
that must hold for *every* input -- cross-table consistency and the
missing-animal ("an animal dies / never shows up") contracts.

Inputs are kept inside a single light_phase occurrence (day 1, hour 12) so the
run-length ``phase_count`` of the hand-built frames matches the dense grid's
numbering (the phase_count footgun documented in strategies.py). Per animal the
generated cage stays never overlap in time, which is what the real data
guarantees and what the bitmask co-occupancy sweep relies on.

The steps read their input via ``Recording.load_results``; instead of the ``monkeypatch``
fixture (which trips Hypothesis's function-scoped-fixture health check) we swap the
attribute directly and restore it, and call the step directly.
