# Using the app

The app runs the DeepEcoHab pipeline in your browser, with no code involved. You create a project,
add your recordings, run the analysis, look through each recording, build plots across
the whole project and export figures for a paper. It all runs on your own computer: the app
reads and writes the project folders on your disk, and the browser only remembers which
projects you have opened.

This chapter follows one project from start to finish. It uses the six example recordings in
`examples/data` of the repository, so you can follow along with the same files. Each part
has a short video; the screenshots and steps underneath cover the same ground at your own pace.

## Start the app

Install DeepEcoHab with the `app` extra, as described in
[Getting started](./getting_started.md#installation), then run:

```
deepecohab-app
```

Your browser opens the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`. Leave the terminal open while you
work, and press `Ctrl+C` in it to stop the app.

| option | effect |
|---|---|
| `--port 8060` | serve on another port, if 8050 is taken |
| `--host 0.0.0.0` | accept connections from other computers on your network, not only this one |
| `--no-browser` | do not open a browser tab; go to the address yourself |
| `--debug` | print warnings and errors in the terminal instead of the log file |

Without `--debug`, warnings and errors go to `~/.deepecohab/app-cache/app.log`. That is the
file to attach when you report a problem.

```{figure} images/app/projects-empty.png
:alt: The Projects page of a fresh install, with an empty project list

The first time you start the app, the project list is empty.
```

The sidebar on the left leads to the three pages: **Projects**, **Recording dashboard** and
**Plot builder**. **Collapse**, at its foot, shrinks it to icons. The button in the top right
switches between the dark and the light theme. The app starts in the theme your system uses,
and the browser remembers your choice from then on.

```{figure} images/app/theme-light.png
:alt: The recording dashboard in the light theme

The same page in the light theme. Plots follow the theme too.
```

## Projects

A project is one folder holding any number of recordings, usually one experiment or one
line of mice. Everything starts on the Projects page.

```{figure} images/app/projects-overview.png
:alt: The Projects page with one project open and its six recordings analysed

The Projects page, with one project opened to show its recordings.
```

1. **New project** creates a project.
2. **Add project** opens a project that already exists on disk.
3. The filter shows only projects and recordings whose names contain what you type.
4. The arrow, or the project's name, opens and closes the list of its recordings.
5. How many of the project's recordings are analysed. **Project table** next to it says
   whether the table the plot builder reads has been generated, and how many rows it has.
6. The project menu (see [The project menu](#the-project-menu)).
7. Tick recordings to analyse them.
8. Each recording's status: how many of the 13 analysis steps are done.
9. Download the recording's data, **Open** its dashboard, or remove it from the project.

For each recording, the table also shows its **Window** (first and last day, and its
time zone), how many days and phases it spans, how many mice it holds, the cohort's
traits (mouse line, genotype, sex) and how many events it declares.

[Watch on YouTube: create a project and add recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QBjaU-gQQ0)

### Create a project

1. Click **New project**.
2. Fill in **Project name** and **Experimenter**. Both are required.
3. Leave **Folder** empty to create the project in `Documents/deepecohab/projects`, or give
   another folder. Either way the project gets its own folder inside it, named after the
   project.
4. Optionally, add a **Description**: cohorts, treatment, what the project is for. It is
   shown under the project's name.
5. Click **Create project**.

```{figure} images/app/new-project-modal.png
:alt: The New project dialog with a name, an experimenter and a description filled in
:width: 60%

The New project dialog.
```

### Open an existing project

A project created earlier, in this browser or another one, or copied from a colleague,
opens with **Add project**. Paste the path of its folder, the one that holds `project.json`,
and click **Add project**.

```{figure} images/app/add-project-modal.png
:alt: The Add project dialog asking for the project folder
:width: 60%

Add project takes the folder that holds `project.json`.
```

The project list is kept by this browser only. Another browser, or another computer,
starts with an empty list; add the folders there too. Adding or removing a project from the
list never moves or deletes its files.

### Add recordings

Each recording is two files with the same name:

- `<name>.json`, the recording's metadata: its habitat layout, light cycle, cohort and
  events;
- `<name>.parquet`, the antenna registrations.

To add recordings:

1. Open the project's row, with the arrow or the project's name.
2. Click **Add recordings** under its table. The project menu has the same entry.
3. Drop the files onto the dialog, or click it to pick them. Add both files of every recording,
   as many recordings as you like, in one go.

```{figure} images/app/add-recordings-modal.png
:alt: The Add recordings dialog with its drop zone
:width: 60%

Files pair up by name: `<name>.json` with `<name>.parquet`.
```

The files are copied into the project, so the originals stay where they were. A file without
its partner, or metadata that does not validate, is listed in the dialog under **Not
added** with the reason. Every other recording is added.

```{figure} images/app/project-recordings.png
:alt: The project's six recordings listed as not analysed

Six recordings added. None of them is analysed yet.
```

### Run the analysis

<iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; border: 0;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hW57KTr94mk" title="DeepEcoHab: run the analysis" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Watch on YouTube: run the analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW57KTr94mk)

1. Tick the recordings to analyse. The box in the table's header ticks every recording shown.
   A bar appears at the bottom of the page.

   ```{figure} images/app/action-bar.png
   :alt: The action bar with six recordings selected

   The action bar. **Clear** unticks everything.
   ```

2. Optionally, click **Parameters** to change the analysis thresholds, then **Apply**.
   They are used by the next run you start. **Reset to defaults** puts the defaults back.

   ```{figure} images/app/params-drawer.png
   :alt: The Analysis parameters drawer
   :width: 45%

   The analysis parameters.
   ```

   | parameter | default | what it does |
   |---|---|---|
   | Minimum meeting (`minimum_time`) | 2 s | the shortest time two animals must spend together for it to count as a meeting; 0 keeps every meeting |
   | Minimum time alone (`minimum_time_alone`) | 10 s | the shortest spell an animal must spend alone for it to count; drops the brief gaps left when animals arrive moments apart |
   | Chasing window (`chasing_time_window`) | 0.1 - 1.2 s | the shortest and longest chasing event |
   | Previous ranking | none | an earlier `ranking.parquet` (or CSV) of the same animals, renamed after the selected recording it is for (`<recording>.parquet`); it is stored with that recording as soon as you drop it, and the recording's dominance ranking then starts from each animal's last rating instead of from scratch |

3. Leave **Overwrite existing tables** off to build only what is missing. Turn it on to
   rebuild every table of the selected recordings, for example after changing a
   parameter. While it is on, **Use stored previous rankings** chooses whether a rebuilt
   ranking starts from the stored previous ranking.
4. Click **Run analysis**.

Each recording counts off its steps as it runs, with the table it is building. The bar at the
bottom shows the progress of the whole run. **Cancel** stops the run once the recordings in
progress finish their current step.

```{figure} images/app/run-progress.png
:alt: Six recordings being analysed, each showing its step count

An analysis in progress.
```

When a run ends, each recording shows its status:

- **Analysed**: all 13 tables are built.
- **Partial**: some tables are built. Run the analysis again to finish it.
- **Not analysed**: no tables yet.
- **Failed**: the run stopped with an error. Hover over the badge to read it.

### The project menu

The menu at the end of a project's row (&#8942;) holds everything that acts on the project as a
whole.

```{figure} images/app/project-menu.png
:alt: The project menu
:width: 35%

The project menu.
```

- **Open in plot builder** opens the [plot builder](#plot-builder) on this project.
- **Add recordings…** is the same as the button under the recordings table.
- **Generate project table** pools the results of every analysed recording into one
  table, `project_table.parquet`, in the project folder. The plot builder reads this table.
  Generate it again after analysing new recordings.
- **Download** gives the project table as Parquet or CSV, or the whole project as a zip:
  every recording's config and results, with or without the raw registrations.
- **Copy path** copies the project's folder path.
- **Remove from list** takes the project off this browser's list. Its files stay on disk,
  and **Add project** brings it back.

### Download or remove a recording

The download button in a recording's row offers:

- every analysis table in one zip, as Parquet or CSV;
- the cohort as CSV;
- the recording's config as JSON;
- the raw registrations as Parquet.

```{figure} images/app/recording-download-menu.png
:alt: The download menu of one recording
:width: 35%

A recording's downloads.
```

The bin button removes a recording from the project. **Delist, keep files** takes it off the
list and leaves its folder where it is, so adding its files again brings it back. **Delete
files** also deletes the recording's folder: its config, raw registrations and results.
Deleting cannot be undone.

```{figure} images/app/remove-recording-modal.png
:alt: The Remove recording dialog with Delist and Delete choices
:width: 60%

Delisting keeps the files. Deleting removes them for good.
```

## Recording dashboard

**Open**, in a recording's row, takes you to the recording's dashboard. There you look through
one recording: first whether its data can be trusted, then what the animals did.

<iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; border: 0;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AByrGMdzCxY" title="DeepEcoHab: the recording dashboard" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Watch on YouTube: the recording dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AByrGMdzCxY)

```{figure} images/app/dashboard-overview.png
:alt: The recording dashboard, opened on its Diagnostics tab

The recording dashboard.
```

1. The recording shown. Pick another from the list, or step through the project's
   recordings with the arrows.
2. A summary of the recording:
   - the dates it ran (hover to see its time zone);
   - how many days and phases it spans, and which phase day 1 starts with;
   - the number of mice;
   - its cages and tunnels (click to jump to the habitat map);
   - its events (hover for their names).
3. The share of antenna passes the hardware missed, with a quality badge. Click it to
   jump to Diagnostics.
4. **Notes** on the recording.
5. **Download** the recording's data. This menu also lists every table one by one.
6. The control bar, which filters every plot on the page.
7. The tabs.
8. Each plot's own buttons (see [A plot card](#a-plot-card)).

### The control bar

```{figure} images/app/dashboard-controls.png
:alt: The control bar of the recording dashboard

The control bar.
```

- **Window** counts the recording in **Days** or in **Phases**. Each light and each dark
  phase counts as one phase.
- The first slider narrows the plots to a stretch of those days or phases.
- **Hours** narrows the plots to part of the day. Hours count from the onset of the phase
  the recording starts with, and the labels show the clock time. The coloured band under
  the slider marks the light and the dark phase.
- **Phases** switches the light and the dark phase on and off.
- **Animals by** colours the animals by their tag, or by any cohort attribute that differs
  between them, such as genotype or sex.
- **Group mean** draws one line per group instead of one per animal. It is available
  when the animals are coloured by a group, not by their tag or name.
- **Events** shows or hides the shading that marks each event on the plots with a time axis.
- **Cohort** lists the animals with their colour. Click an animal to write notes about it.

```{figure} images/app/cohort-popover.png
:alt: The Cohort list, each animal with its colour, name, sex, genotype and age
:width: 40%

The cohort, as coloured on every plot.
```

A plot that cannot follow one of the controls says so with a badge. **Whole day** means
the plot has no hourly breakdown, so it ignores the Hours window. **Per animal** means the
plot shows one line per animal whatever Group mean says.

### The tabs

**Diagnostics** comes first, because whether the acquisition can be trusted is the question
to settle before reading anything the analysis says.

- **Detection quality**: the share of missed passes, the number of detections, the
  worst antenna and the worst animal, the animal-antenna pairs without a miss, and the
  share of time an animal's position is unknown. The bands are provisional, to be
  confirmed on more recordings: under 1% missed is good, 1-2.5% needs checking, and 2.5%
  or more is poor.
- **Habitat**: the cages, tunnels and antennas as the recording's config lays them out.
  Each antenna is tinted by how many passes it missed.
- **Missed passes per antenna**, pooled over the cohort, so a failing antenna stands out.
- **Missed passes by animal and antenna**, the share of each animal's passes over each
  antenna that went unrecorded.
- **Position unknown**, the time each animal spent where the antennas could not place it.

```{figure} images/app/tab-diagnostics.png
:alt: The Diagnostics tab
```

**Overview** sums up the recording:

- **Recording at a glance**: its duration, registrations, chasings and busiest cage.
- **Feature overview**: dominance, activity and proximity measures, each z-scored, on
  one polar chart.
- **Cohort**: the cohort table. Click an animal for its notes.
- **Recording pulse**: the cohort's visits per hour, one row per day, with the hours of
  each event outlined.
- **Habitat occupancy**: the share of the cohort's time spent in each place.
- **Cohort phenotype map**: one marker per animal, showing locomotion, sociality, chasing
  and rank at once.

```{figure} images/app/tab-overview.png
:alt: The Overview tab
```

**Activity** covers where the animals went and when:

- **Position timeline**: each animal's position over time, as a strip.
- **Activity per hour**: antenna detections per hour, which shows the circadian rhythm.
- **Position preference**: how the cohort's time is spread across positions.
- **Activity per position**: visits to each position, or time spent there.
- **Position preference over time**: time in each cage or tunnel, across days or phases.
- **Time per position by hour**: occupancy across the 24 hours of the day.

```{figure} images/app/tab-activity.png
:alt: The Activity tab
```

**Social** covers who spends time with whom:

- **Pairwise sociability**: how often pairs meet, or how long they spend together, per cage
  or tunnel.
- **Within-cohort sociability**: the mean sociability index of every pair.
- **Time spent alone**: time each animal spent with no other animal present.
- **Sociability network**: pairs linked by the time they spend together.
- **Relationship stability**: how stable each pair's relationship is, against the time
  they share.

```{figure} images/app/tab-social.png
:alt: The Social tab
```

**Dominance** covers chasing and rank:

- **Dominance ranking**: each animal's ranking over time, or its day-to-day stability.
- **Ranking distribution**: the probability distribution of each animal's ranking on the
  last day in the window.
- **Chasings per hour**: the daily rhythm of chasing.
- **Dominance network**: who chases whom, with node size showing rank.
- **Chasings matrix**: chaser against chased.

```{figure} images/app/tab-dominance.png
:alt: The Dominance tab
```

What each measure means, and which table it comes from, is described in the
[antenna analysis guide](./tutorial_antenna.md#the-analysis-tables).

### A plot card

```{figure} images/app/card-anatomy.png
:alt: A plot card with its title, a Whole day badge, its buttons and its footer

A plot card.
```

1. What the plot shows.
2. A badge, when the plot ignores one of the controls. This one has no hourly breakdown.
3. **Format**: titles, axis ranges and colours (see [Format a plot](#format-a-plot)).
   Formatting applies to this plot on every recording you open, for as long as the
   browser tab stays open.
4. **Export** the plot as a figure file (see [Export a plot](#export-a-plot)).
5. **Full screen**. Press `Esc` to close it.
6. The analysis tables the plot reads.

Some cards have options of their own under their title, such as **Mode** here. A card
whose tables are not built yet says which tables it needs. Run the analysis for the
recording to build them.

### Notes

**Notes** opens the recording's notes. Clicking an animal, in the Cohort card or in the
Cohort list, opens that animal's notes. Notes are saved with the recording, so everyone who
opens the project sees them.

```{figure} images/app/notes-modal.png
:alt: The Notes dialog
:width: 60%

Notes on a recording.
```

## Plot builder

The plot builder charts the whole project at once. It reads the project table, so
generate the table first: **Generate project table** in the
[project menu](#the-project-menu). Then open the builder from the same menu with **Open in
plot builder**.

<iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; border: 0;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L5WByVdDSDU" title="DeepEcoHab: the plot builder" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Watch on YouTube: the plot builder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WByVdDSDU)

```{figure} images/app/builder-overview.png
:alt: The plot builder with a box plot of time alone by genotype and sex

The plot builder, with the preset "Time alone by genotype and sex" loaded.
```

1. How **Value** is summed up (see [Value and metrics](#value-and-metrics)).
2. **Clear shelves** takes every field off the shelves. Filters stay.
3. The project, and how many recordings, rows and metrics its table holds.
4. Presets: ready-made plots, and the ones you saved.
5. The plot type.
6. The fields you can plot.
7. Filters.
8. The shelves: X, Y, Colour and the rest, depending on the plot type. A shelf marked `*`
   is required.
9. The plot.
10. **Save preset**. Next to it are **Reset**, which goes back to the preset you last loaded,
    **Format** and **Export**.

### Value and metrics

The project table holds every metric in one column. Each row is one animal, in one
recording, in one hour of one day, for one metric:

- **Metric** names what the row measures;
- **Value** is how much of it there was;
- the table also records how long the animal was observed in that hour.

| metric | Value is summed up as |
|---|---|
| `activity` | visits per hour |
| `time_alone` | fraction of time |
| `time_together` | fraction of time, per partner |
| `pairwise_encounters` | encounters per partner-hour |
| `n_chasing`, `n_chased` | chasings per partner-hour |
| `n_chasing_per_detection` | chasings per detection |

Because metrics have different units, keep one metric per axis. Tick a single metric
under **Metric** in Filters, or put **Metric** on a shelf such as Facet row, so that each
metric gets its own axis. If you drop Value while several metrics are ticked, the builder
puts Metric on Facet row for you. When units would still mix, a warning above the plot
says so.

The buttons above the presets choose how Value is summed up within each point, box or
bar:

- **Rate**, the default, is the total Value divided by the time observed, so it reads the
  same whether you pool hours, days or whole recordings;
- **Total** is the sum of Value;
- **Exposure, h** is the number of hours observed;
- **Hourly mean** is the mean over hourly rows.

### Presets

The built-in presets are a quick way to start. Click one to load it, then change what you
like.

| preset | what it shows |
|---|---|
| Time alone by genotype and sex | one point per animal: its share of observed time spent without company |
| Circadian activity by genotype | visits per hour across the 24 hours after phase onset, pooled per genotype |
| Time together over the shared days | only the days every recording has, worked out from the project when the preset opens |
| Light vs dark, four metrics | four metrics side by side, each on its own axis |
| Activity around an event | activity in the hours an event ran, against the same clock hours on other days and all other hours |
| Chasing against cohort size | one point per recording: are larger cohorts more aggressive per partner? |

**Activity around an event** asks which event to use when you click it, with the number of
recordings that declare each event. **Any event** pools them all.

```{figure} images/app/builder-event-preset.png
:alt: The event menu of the Activity around an event preset
:width: 40%

The event preset asks which event to use.
```

**Save preset** keeps the current plot, its filters and its formatting. Give it a name and
choose where to keep it:

- **In this browser**: only you see it, on this computer.
- **In the project**: it is written to `builder_presets.json` in the project folder, so
  everyone who opens the project gets it.

```{figure} images/app/preset-save-modal.png
:alt: The Save preset dialog
:width: 55%

Saving a preset.
```

A saved preset appears at the end of the presets strip. Its bin button deletes it. Once
you change a loaded preset, the plot's title says "(edited)", and **Reset** goes back
to it.

### Build a plot

1. Pick a plot type. The shelves change with it: a box plot needs Y, a scatter plot needs
   X and Y, and a sunburst needs Path and Values.
2. Drag fields from **Fields** onto the shelves. You can also click a field and pick a
   shelf from its **Send to** menu.

   ```{figure} images/app/builder-send-menu.png
   :alt: The Send to menu of the genotype field
   :width: 30%

   Clicking a field lists the shelves that take it.
   ```

3. To remove a field, click the `×` on its chip, or drag it back to Fields.

The coloured edge of each field shows its kind:

- **measure** (orange): numbers to plot, chiefly Value;
- **category** (blue): groups, such as genotype, sex, phase or recording;
- **ordered** (green): values in order, such as day, hour, phase count, age or cohort size.

The fields come in groups:

- **Measure**: Value and Metric.
- **Time**: phase, day, phase count, hour.
- **Events**: one field per event the project declares, plus **Any event**. Each reads
  **During** in the hours the event ran, **Same hours, other days** at the same clock
  hours on the other days, and **Other hours** otherwise. A recording that does not declare
  the event is left out.
- **Animal**: tag, name and the cohort attributes.
- **Recording**: the recording's name and its number of mice.

The **Detail** shelf splits the data into groups without drawing them. Box, violin, strip,
histogram and ECDF plots fill it with recording and animal id, so each box is a spread over
animals rather than one number. An ordered field on a shelf can also be grouped into
blocks: click it and type, for example, `3` for blocks of three, or `1-3, 4-6`.

### Filters

Drop a category or ordered field on **Filters** to limit what is plotted.

```{figure} images/app/builder-filters.png
:alt: The Filters panel with metric, day and genotype filters

Filters for metric, day and genotype.
```

- A category lists its values. Tick the ones to keep; with none ticked, all are kept.
- Day, phase count, hour and number of mice offer a **Range** or **Pick values**.
- Other ordered fields, such as age, take a range.

## Format and export

The recording dashboard and the plot builder share two dialogs: **Format**, to adjust a
plot on screen, and **Export**, to render it as a file.

<iframe style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; border: 0;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xqHgddq532U" title="DeepEcoHab: format and export a plot" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[Watch on YouTube: format and export a plot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHgddq532U)

### Format a plot

```{figure} images/app/format-dialog.png
:alt: The Format dialog
:width: 40%

The Format dialog.
```

Every field left empty stays automatic, and each shows its automatic value in grey:

- **Title** (plot builder only), **X axis title** and **Y axis title**;
- the **min** and **max** of each axis;
- the colour bar's title and range, on plots that have one;
- the **Colour scale** of heatmaps and the **Category palette** of groups. A palette with
  fewer colours than the plot has groups cannot be picked.

A field that does not apply to the plot is greyed out. A title you set stays with its axis
only while the same field is on it: put another field there and the axis goes back to
automatic. **Reset formatting** clears every field. In the builder, formatting is saved
with the preset.

### Export a plot

```{figure} images/app/export-dialog.png
:alt: The Export plot dialog with a preview on the left and the settings on the right

The Export dialog.
```

- **Style**: **Publication** renders the plot on white in a plain journal style. **App
  theme** keeps the app's look.
- **Format**: SVG, PDF or PNG. PNG adds **Resolution**, 300 or 600 dpi.
- **Size**: 85, 114 or 174 mm wide, the usual journal column widths, or **Custom**. The
  width and height are in millimetres.
- **Font size**, from 6 to 12 pt.
- **Include**: the legend, the title, the event labels, and the plotted data as CSV, which
  comes in one zip with the figure.
- **File name**.

The preview on the left is the file itself, scaled down to fit. The file is laid out at the
size you chose: text is set at your font size, the legend always sits beside the plot, and
crowded tick labels are thinned out. Anything that still does not fit is listed under the
preview as a warning, such as a legend too wide for the width. Click **Download** to save
the file.

## Where things are kept

Almost everything lives in the project folder on disk:

```
my_project/
  project.json            the project
  project.log             what was done to it, and when
  project_table.parquet   what the plot builder reads
  builder_presets.json    presets saved "in the project"
  recording_name/
    config.json           metadata and notes
    raw/data.parquet      antenna registrations
    results/              one Parquet file per analysis table
```

The browser keeps only two things: the list of projects you have opened, and the presets
you saved "in this browser". Clearing the browser's site data forgets both, but no project
on disk is touched. Add the projects again to bring them back.
