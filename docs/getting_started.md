# What is DeepEcoHab?

DeepEcoHab is a package for analysis of data acquired in the EcoHab system - a semi-naturalistic cage design for long-term recording of a group of up to 12 mice.
The package provides four modules:

### 1. Antenna analysis
`deepecohab.core` - a set of optimized, fast functions to analyze your experiments purely on information obtained from animals crossing the antennas: time spent in cages and tunnels, number of visits, time alone, chasings and dominance ranking, pairwise meetings, in-cohort sociability, a per-antenna report of how much of the movement the hardware caught, and a feature table that compares animals across recordings. Provides an approximate picture of the social structure and social hierarchy type.

### 2. Auxiliary analyses
`deepecohab.auxiliary_analysis` - analyses kept outside the routine pipeline, which you run yourself when you need them, such as the spontaneous tube test.

### 3. Plotting
`deepecohab.plotting` - interactive Plotly figures of the most important results, built straight from an analysed recording.

### 4. Web app
`deepecohab.app` - a browser GUI over the same pipeline: create a project, add recordings, run the analysis, build plots and export them without writing any code. It ships with the `app` extra and is started with `deepecohab-app`.

Analysis of pose estimation data is planned.

Organise your recordings into a project, then analyze them step by step or run the whole pipeline over every recording with one call.

## Installation

DeepEcoHab requires Python 3.12 or newer. In the spirit of open-source we recommend the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package and project manager to work with deepecohab.

### Step 1 — Install `uv`

**Windows:**
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2 — Install DeepEcoHab

```
uv venv
# Windows:        .venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS:  source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "deepecohab[app]"
```

Already have an environment running `python>=3.12`? Just run `pip install "deepecohab[app]"`.

### Step 3 — Start the app

```
deepecohab-app
```

The app opens in your browser. Create a project, add your recordings, run the analysis and
build plots — no code involved. This is how we expect most people to use DeepEcoHab.

### Working from code instead

The app is an extra because the analysis itself does not need Dash. If you only want the
library, install it with the notebook extra, which adds the Jupyter kernel and what
`figure.show()` needs inside a notebook (plain scripts can drop `[notebook]`):

```
uv pip install "deepecohab[notebook]"
```

We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the Jupyter
extension to run the example notebooks provided in the repository.

To install from source:

```
cd location_to_clone_to
git clone https://github.com/KonradDanielewski/DeepEcoHab.git
cd DeepEcoHab
pip install ".[app]"
```

## Data structure of DeepEcoHab

A project is a directory. Each recording in it keeps its validated metadata, a copy of its antenna registrations, and the results of its analysis - one [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) file per table, read with [Polars](https://pola.rs/):

```
my_project/
  project.json
  project.log
  recording_name/
    config.json
    raw/data.parquet
    results/
      main_df.parquet
      activity_df.parquet
      ...
```

To load a table, open the project and ask the recording for it by name:

```python
import deepecohab as deh

project = deh.Project.load("path/to/my_project")
activity = project["recording_name"].load_results("activity_df")
```

Every table, and what it holds, is described in the [antenna analysis guide](./tutorial_antenna.md#the-analysis-tables).

## Data Visualization

Plots are built from an analysed recording by name:

```python
figure = deh.plot("activity-bar", project["recording_name"])
figure.show()
```

Every figure is a Plotly figure, so it can be modified further, saved as an interactive `.html` file with `figure.write_html()`, exported as an image in a preferred format and resolution for publication with `figure.write_image()`, or saved as JSON with `figure.write_json()` and reopened with `plotly.io.read_json()`. See [Plotting](./plotting.md) for every available plot and its options.
