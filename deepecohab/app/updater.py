"""Upgrade DeepEcoHab and start it again.

Windows cannot replace a file a running process has loaded, so there the app hands the
upgrade to a helper and exits: :func:`spawn_helper` runs this file as a script, which
waits for the app to exit, upgrades and starts the app again in its own console. That
is why this module is stdlib only and the helper runs on the base interpreter - importing
the deepecohab package would load polars and dash from the environment being upgraded.
POSIX replaces files by rename, so there the app upgrades in place and execs itself.
