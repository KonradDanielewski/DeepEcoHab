	The table is long: one row per animal-hour *per metric*, so a bare ``value``
	column pools quantities that share no units. Rather than pivoting each metric
	into its own chip, ``value`` is one measure and ``metric`` is the dimension that
	says which metric it is - filter it to one, or facet by it, and the shelves take
	care of the rest (see ``figure.warnings_for``). ``age`` becomes whole days, since
	a birth date is what is recorded but age in days is what gets plotted. Every
	remaining column is classified from its dtype rather than by name, so a project
	table that gains a column gains a chip - grouped under "Events" when its name is
	one of ``event_names`` and not a column deepecohab always produces, else under
	whichever ``GROUPS`` names, defaulting to "Recording".

		event_names: every event name declared anywhere in the project, plus

			event_status` added to the table.
